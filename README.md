# HighScore-Quiz

I've created the html for the quiz
In the html I've linked the javascript and css sheet so that the website becomes interactive
I have created a main body for the website which includes the title of the quiz, the questions and the 'start' and 'next buttons
Then I've created a css sheet for the website
Then i have styled the website gicing it a background color
Then I've added colour, padding, margins and fonts to the text
